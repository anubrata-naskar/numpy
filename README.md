# NumPy Learning Project

A comprehensive project for learning and exploring NumPy functionality through hands-on examples and exercises.

## Project Overview

This project contains multiple phases that progressively introduce NumPy concepts, from basic array operations to advanced data manipulation and visualization.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or VS Code with Jupyter extension

### Installation

1. Clone or download this project
2. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   # On Windows
   myenv\Scripts\activate
   
   # On macOS/Linux
   source myenv/bin/activate
   ```
3. Install required packages (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   pip install numpy matplotlib jupyter
   ```

### Running the Notebooks

Open any of the phase notebooks in Jupyter or VS Code to start learning:

- **Phase 1**: Basic array creation, indexing, and slicing
- **Phase 2**: Mathematical operations, broadcasting, and array methods
- **Phase 3**: Advanced operations, linear algebra, and performance optimization
- **Phase 4**: File operations, saving/loading arrays, and data visualization

## Features Covered

- ✅ Array creation and initialization
- ✅ Array indexing and slicing
- ✅ Mathematical operations
- ✅ Broadcasting
- ✅ File I/O operations (save/load arrays)
- ✅ Data visualization with matplotlib
- ✅ Array manipulation and reshaping
- ✅ Statistical operations

## Sample Data

The project includes several sample arrays:
- `array1.npy`: Basic 2D array for practice
- `array2.npy`: Random array for statistical operations
- `array3.npy`: Zero array for initialization examples
- `numpy-logo.npy`: NumPy logo for image processing exercises
